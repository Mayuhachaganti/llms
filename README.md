This project focuses on applying Learning with Label Misalignment (LLMS) techniques to enhance sentiment analysis on an Amazon reviews dataset. The challenge lies in mitigating label noise introduced by factors like human error and ambiguity in sentiment classification. Key strategies include noise modeling, robust model training, and validation techniques to ensure accurate sentiment prediction despite noisy labels. By implementing these approaches, the project aims to improve model robustness and performance in real-world applications of sentiment analysis.

Note: The File consists of same Code except the part where Level of noise in the labels need to be changed.
